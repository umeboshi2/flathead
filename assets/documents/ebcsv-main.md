## Introduction

You can "[upload](#ebcsv/xml/upload)" a clz xml collection "into" 
the browser to help create a csv file for <a href="http://bulksell.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?FileExchangeUploadForm" target="_blank">
EBay File Exchange</a>.  After you import the xml file into the 
app, you can then [create](#ebcsv/csv/create) a csv file using 
a selected [config](#ebcsv/cfg/list) and 
[description](#ebcsv/dsc/list).


If you have already imported some comics into the app, you can view 
them [here](#ebcsv/comics/local) (you will be redirected to the 
file input form if no comics have been imported).
